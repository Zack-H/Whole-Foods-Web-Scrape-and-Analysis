Data
The data for this project came directly from Whole Foods website (https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/products/all-products). 
By passing in parameters to retrieve only items on sale and for a specific store, I retrieved only the items on sale at my local store as opssed to all items for sale.
Since the dataset was limited to only items on sale at one store for one week, there were a limited number of results. Additionally, not all items had a sale price and prime price, since not all items offer an extra discount to Prime members.
